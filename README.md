# EL-TCP-Congestion-Control
A description of number of NS2 simulation experiments to understand TCP congestion control.   
A number of experiments are described to under all three phases of congestion control i.e. *Slow Start*, *Congestion Avoidance* and *Fast Recovery*.
An experiment also described on how to analyze TCP Fairness.
